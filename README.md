This is a simple E-Commerce built in React. It integrates with Firebase, for Google Sign In and Sign Up and Email and Password Sign in and Sign Up, and to make use of the Firestore Database, to store the shop's products. It has a Cart feature, that lets users add items to the cart and a checkout page, in where, in the future, i will implement payments with Stripe. This app uses React Context for State Management, but right now i am starting to convert everything to React Redux. In the future i will convert everything to Typescript too.

## How to Use

If you wish to run this project on your own computer you can clone it. After that you just need to create a folder inside utils named "firebase" and inside create a file named firebase.utils.js in where you will copy all the code necessary to integrate with Firebase (you will need to create your own project with your google account in firebase console). Done with that, you can write in your terminal "npm start" to start the development server.
